<h2>Golden-ringed dragonfly</h2>
<p>
In my Bachelor's thesis, I conducted a qualitative assessment of the golden-ringed dragonfly species, Cordulegaster boltonii and Cordulegaster bidentata, in selected waters within the Arnsberger Wald FFH area. I focused on their distribution, changes compared to data from 2003/04, habitat preferences, and the impact of recent dry conditions. I also proposed conservation measures tailored to their environmental sensitivities and habitat needs. At the bottom, I provide the entire thesis (as a .pdf in German) along with the raw data (observational data as a table) for download. The findings and data are intended for further use and dissemination.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
In this comprehensive Bachelor's thesis, the focus is on the detailed examination of the distribution patterns and preferred habitats of the golden-ringed dragonflies, Cordulegaster boltonii and Cordulegaster bidentata, within the designated FFH area of Arnsberger Wald. This study provides a critical comparison with historical data collected in 2003/04, offering insights into shifts in population dynamics and habitat utilization over time. The analysis extends to evaluating the repercussions of recent adverse climatic events, notably prolonged dry periods, on these species. The thesis culminates in proposing targeted conservation measures, emphasizing the necessity of preserving and restoring the specific aquatic and terrestrial habitats these dragonflies depend on, thereby ensuring their continued presence and ecological function within this valuable forest ecosystem.
