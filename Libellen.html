<h2>Studies on dragonflies</h2>
<p>
My fascination with dragonflies began while searching for a topic for my bachelor's thesis. It was during this time that I met Ralf Joest, who introduced me to the intriguing world of golden-ringed dragonflies. This encounter sparked a profound interest in dragonfly identification, leading me to attend various seminars and workshops to deepen my knowledge. Since then, I have conducted numerous surveys on dragonflies, primarily focusing on their preservation, which has become a significant part of my academic and research pursuits.
