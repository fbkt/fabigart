<h2>Professional Work</h2>
<p>
I am an environmental professional with a Master's degree in Geography, specializing in City and Landscape Ecology from Ruhr-University Bochum. My academic work has centered on dragonfly fauna.
<p>
My professional experience covers landscape ecology, species conservation, and environmental planning and I have contributed as an ecological consultant and local species protection program advisor.
<p>
Currently, I am leading a company that conducts environmental evaluations and faunistic surveys, ensuring biodiversity considerations are integrated into various development projects. My commitment to the environment extends to volunteer work with <a href="https://www.nabu-hagen.de/">NABU Hagen</a>.
