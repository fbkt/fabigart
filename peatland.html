<h2>Peatland dragonflies</h2>
<p>
For my master's degree in Geography with a specialization in "Urban and Landscape Ecology," my thesis focused on species of moorland dragonflies. At the bottom, I provide the entire thesis (as a .pdf in German) along with the raw data (observational data as a table) for download. The findings and data are intended for further use and dissemination.
<p>
In my thesis, titled "Monitoring of the Dragonfly Fauna ('Odonata') on 'Auf dem Mörth' in the SAC Schwalenberger Wald (Lippe District, NRW)," which I submitted to the Geographical Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum in 2022, I embarked on a comprehensive study of the dragonfly species inhabiting eight peatland ponds within the Schwalenberger Wald, a Special Area of Conservation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. My aim was to update and expand upon the research previously conducted in 2014 by Mathias Lohr, focusing on the changes in dragonfly populations and assessing the potential impacts of environmental factors.
<p>
My research successfully identified a total of 24 dragonfly species, with 18 of them being either definitely or probably established in the area. I observed notable changes in species composition compared to the data from 2014, with five species no longer present and seven new species making an appearance. I propose that factors such as climate change, shifts in vegetation, and biotic homogenization could be the driving forces behind these changes. Moreover, the introduction of goldfish in one of the ponds might have altered the habitat significantly, resulting in the disappearance of three peatland dragonfly species.
<p>
I highlighted the significance of the ponds in the Mörth area as crucial habitats for endangered peatland dragonfly species in the region, despite a slight decline in habitat quality since 2014. Through this thesis, I aim to contribute valuable insights into the conservation of dragonfly species in peatland habitats and shed light on the broader implications of environmental changes on biodiversity.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
Monitoring of the Odonata fauna on the “Mörth” in the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Schwalenberger Wald (Lippe, North Rhine-Westphalia) – In 2022, the dragonfly fauna was surveyed at eight peatland ponds in the “Mörth”-area in the Special Area of Conservation Schwalenberger Wald, district Lippe, North Rhine-Westphalia. The results were compared with a survey of the same ponds by Mathias Lohr from 2014.
<p>
A total of 24 dragonfly species were found, of which 18 are definitely or probably established. Except for S. danae, the peatland species Coenagrion hastulatum, Lestes virens, Aeshna juncea, Leucorrhinia dubia, L. pectoralis and Sympetrum danae were found to be definitely or probably established. C. hastulatum and L. pectoralis are “critically endangered" in North Rhine-Westphalia.
<p>
Compared to 2014, five species could no longer be found. Seven species have been added. Despite this increase in dragonfly species overall, the peatland species Aeshna subarctica and Leucorrhinia rubicunda could no longer be observed in 2022.
<p>
In both 2014 and 2022, two ponds had the highest dragonfly diversity in general and also most peatland species. For these ponds, a loss of four established peatland species could be determined.
The changes in occurrences can be explained by global warming, the resulting change in vegetation, and biotic homogenization.
<p>
In another pond, three peatland species could no longer be detected as established, for which the introduced Goldfish (Carassius gibelio forma auratus) could be responsible.
While C. hastulatum, L. dubia and S. danae show a negative trend nationwide, these species could be observed in the study area in 2014 as well as in 2022.
<p>
The occurrence of L. pectoralis in 2022 is to be rated as very positive, since one of the largest occurrences of the species in North Rhine-Westphalia was found in 2014 at a pond in the study area.
It was shown that, despite a slight deterioration in the occurrence of peatland species since 2014, the ponds in the Mörth-area represent an important habitat for many of the endangered peatland dragonfly species for the Weserbergland and North Rhine-Westphalia.
